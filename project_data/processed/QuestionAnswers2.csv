1145,why few targets are better than manythe economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in  were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the worlds leading economy by but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesnt become a global economic laggard they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states thats why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missedlisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said the status quo is not an optionat risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said the report comes at a time when europes competitive position is waning the eus economic growth rate is projected to be  this year and  next while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few yearsas mr koks report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suitthe circumstances werent conducive to creating the  million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in  neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a socalled knowledgebased economy the lisbon vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brusselsbased citizen action group what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change you find trade unions fighting change but also the employers associations even though they tell you theyre in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activitybut part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritisedlisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said everybody is responsible and thus no one thats why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to  key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps theyre taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming rhetoric and delivery dont necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we dont have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one anotheron one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth its very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brusselsbased thinktank this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do its going to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report doesnt come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it doesnt say how companies should be convinced to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr koks recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso has said that the eus competitiveness will be his top priority he expects his fiveyear term in office to be judged on europes success in meeting the lisbon agenda,0

you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touchworking from home presents a multitude of challenges understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others  or are you a more introspective problem solver in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming a loose association of likeminded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy  with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrectedprior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made waterandweathertight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracingideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for a wellinsulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interiorplease click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for mariannes barnthe layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplaceregarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible a wireless routeraccess point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you havent already invested in robust firewall and antivirus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse

1244,the ticking budget facing the usthe budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial the washingtonbased economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come under direct threat will be the federal governments ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as  the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefitsthe trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in  years by conservative estimates to more than half the nations total annual outputthis upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business even now a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations this does not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue the dollar is already sinking before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards that will be the shockinterestsensitive industries will feel pain immediately  sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late s there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely is another matter how did this happenby definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending  but this neutral description doesnt adequately capture the current situation federal revenues are at s levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades  much higher in addition the united states has two significant military missions the bush administrations chosen remedy is the least feasible one reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left law enforcement space exploration environmental cleanup economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear its fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world but serious savings can only be found where the big money is savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cuts or spending caps would illserve the nations elderly and indigenton the revenue side the lions share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since  will have to be replacedsome rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts second should be a dispassionate reevaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of a serious debate on largescale health care reform one thing is certain  destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century,0

1265,could yukos be a blessing in disguiseother things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for businessbut in the lookingglass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report has argued the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors saythe papers reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance  in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundnessafter vladimir putin became president in  he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort  too much critics argue  into enforcementsince then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year after mr putin came to power the companys overall effective tax rate rose from  to  and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends  m in  and almost bn in   and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peersdoes this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and lawabiding since  companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges  something unthinkable in the wilder days of the s  and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts  bn in   and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearlydefined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia  connections often greased by bribery  blur the apparently antagonistic relationship companies can for example persuade officials to overlook nonpayment of taxesand the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by   an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance,0

we can live longer whether its the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japans elderly are remarkable but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the worlds least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the usby  japans population is expected

further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staffstanding next to tokyo

1329,fresh hope after argentine crisisthree years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hopethe countrys economy is set to grow about  this year after seeing  growth last year a sharp turnaround from  when output fell  the unemployment rate is improving too it is set to slip below  by the end of the year down from  in may  true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement even the international monetary fund imf admits this the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this monthargentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in  culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the governments decisions pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the countrys massive debts in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month argentina was on the brink of collapse the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the pesos decadelong peg to the us dollar in february  the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of peoples life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was direbut since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentinemr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the startup a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are reopeningbut not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of  president nestor kirchners administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around bn it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentinas current offer implies that the creditors would get just  cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imfs managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuringwith the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as wellthis is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina  said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the countrys legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank,0

1640,franz man seeks government helpfranz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussionfor any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he saidkapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good ideakapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top  singles he told the strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fmhe concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonighti think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labelsrather than expecting the government  ie the taxpayer  to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government fundsif they can fund football why not fund musicareas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cashthe government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into thatas a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goodsi think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorshipyes the government should fund music  it brings joy to the massesthere are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better useas long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked aboutonly if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales  if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician the government shouldnt fund music  it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investmenti think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from therei do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great dealyeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternitiesi agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music  perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music  that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you likethough i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us,0

before sound of  was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv on thursdayim speechless best song of the last  years yeah righti very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better beforegive us a breakbest song in  years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but reallylistened to angels on radio  this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfectionas usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last  years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty lowim actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last  yearswhat about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart angels is middleoftheroad rubbishangels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish musicbest of the last  years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last  years after allits alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last  yearsthere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last  yearsits a travestyrubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio  but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last  years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear fromwhile i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last  years should not include songs less than  years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good showyouve got to be kiddingangels is a great song but not the best song of the last  years only the best song to be up for nomination at the britsi think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past  years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself thoughbest song in the last  years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awardsso boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will youngoh its all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talenti hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance withi agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbiei think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bushangels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groupsrobbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late s and early s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people thinkyes angels is the best song since the past  years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaningive always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisssangels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but  no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a centuryno surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come onwhat a load of crap best song in the last  years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last  years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come closewhat a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past  years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give upwhy do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last  years i think not i didnt realize radio  had so many listeners under the age of people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last  years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for herethe great british public at work again its a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nopeno because im not female and im not ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past  years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a jokepredictable and laughablethe success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last  years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last  yearsi am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the listhave radio  listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last  years than robbie williams ever willno doubt about it theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other songit should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in  years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music todayyes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winneri am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting musicthe best song of the past  years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie downit just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  ltno offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffini think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dustobviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for itif this is the best song of the last  years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best recorda sad day for musicits not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last  years its a good allrounder just like robbiebest song in  years since  im confused angels isnt a bad song its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have becomegranted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for himbest song of the last  years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankfulangels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in  yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winnersit would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with  people singing along to be fully appreciated well done robi find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past  years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popularive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near us new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profitno surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in musicpersonally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heardit absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to comeits an absolute joke however most of the original  were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young thoughalthough it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talentalthough angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last  years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means,0

1765,brits debate over urban musicjoss stone a yearold soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music isim not really comfortable with the word urban its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going onurban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop rb garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a yearold from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done itthe award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv basei dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge peoplewhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or awarda type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban lifeshe might not be urban but when did rb become the hip hop tainted thing it is now rb stands for rhythm and blues rememberthat joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hiphop soul  funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claimshe definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she isshe did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and rb if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strangewhats in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance towhilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an awardso what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it shes  has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this onethis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the s and s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it representsi demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thingexcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black toohow can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsensei love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black  urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their coloursurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that stylethe term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulrnb and hiphop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunkurban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for itim in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just musicas a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both  times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not britsso what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing elseurban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thingrefreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on itthat entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r  b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williamsurban is a nonsense term  music of black origin well doesnt that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in londonmanchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesnt make any sensewhy does music have to be put into a genre its music you like it or you dont simple as thati play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musicallyurban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as suchjoss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignoredyeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music good and bad,0

comparatively lowkey dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel  just over the road from their modern day homejust  guests attended with ticket prices at the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award for the first  years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at pm but in  the winners were published in the los angeles times at pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspensefilled night that happens today when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until  but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinnerthe ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous graumans chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium they are now held at the kodak theatre which opened in  just across the road from its original home and holds  people until  they were held on a thursday

1862,roundabout continues nostalgia tripthe new bigscreen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn childrens television into boxoffice goldrecent years have seen a lessthansuccessful adaptation of the s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbits five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in  heman and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the s will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the ateam the dukes of hazzard and even blakes seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stopmotion models of the s tv show with polished computergenerated animationin a similar fashion the  thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the nowdefunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cganimated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the s stopmotion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies siteand the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry andersons thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic childrens tv shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinventioni can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think its backfiring whats next  the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance  the film cost m â£m but only recouped m â£m  the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatmentafter the success of garfield the movie britains shabby tabbysurely deserves his own film vehicle with only  episodes made of the  series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organfurry recyclershave already had one bigscreen outing  s wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbcs supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tvs most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existedthe magic roundabout is out in the uk on  februaryhow about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his moneythundercats i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth backget your hands off the clangers is nothing sacredmake a movie version of the banana splitswhat about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandyyou forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldnt be better than the original series could itits always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think ive been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memoriesi think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and mask get full hollywood remakesleave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompsonlove to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a  ratingpart of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first placei have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film its got all the right material for an american blockbuster  no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or twoits all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideasall i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a childthere was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation  this time computer created flatcell like animation  failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world  the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from  years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now  its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something newit got to be mrbenn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean charactermuffin the mule perhaps  after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you knowwhy cant the british film industry try making gerry andersons ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow peoplein todays media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or reworking s and s music even computer games from  years ago are getting modern reworkings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our mistyeyed nostalgia alonemary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasnt even thereid like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop ownerit demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in todays filmmakers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the pastmr benn with rowan atkinson as the leadwould have loved to see dungeons  dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch the only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to seeim an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite childrens programs for my  daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavianrainbowi believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years agohow about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and onif a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ill be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon c advertid luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb childrens programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at  im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the storyjust imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike fingermousebob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fallone puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe  it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes car of course gerry andersons supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of bigscreen bigbudget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselvesits only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it id hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation  i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mockauthentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be megathis regurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry  it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the  the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the shortterm the fact that they will be forgotten in  months time is irrelevant eg starsky  hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying iti pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only  and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its a classic the fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real

recently quit the uk independence partysaid our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas  latin for truth  would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroysilkmr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election  that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have leftmr kilroysilk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straightmr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to leadthis is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote furtherthank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the electionit is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infightingukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilkif he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to anotherso ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to followinteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin nameevery opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have comewell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy herelets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurityveritas the

2145,what the election should really be abouta general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring pollweve called for the state pension to be increased from â£ to the pensioner credit guarantee level of â£ thats what were calling for many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system if weve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line weve got to make it more generous or have these people living in povertyweve drawn up a pensioners manifesto this will be sent to each of the candidates in the  constituencies they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support once weve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well its our way of putting the politicians on notice we are trying to get across the fact that there are m voters over  in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters before  most pensioners voted conservative in  and  they voted labour but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for grantedpensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turners full report into the issue he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed worldthat the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environmentwe havent worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing we dont have any large demonstrations planned but they cant be ruled outit is hard to say whether we will be successful we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraqrepealing the hunting billwe are challenging the use of the parliament act  in a high court action we are hoping to hear in the new year whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time when the ban comes into force on  february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid so theres a lot of legal territory to go we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is rural affairs minister alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult it is not intimidatory  on the whole it is groups of angry housewives of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anythingit will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face its exactly what the prime minister did not want he wanted the issue off the table until after the electionpeople using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting it is another sort of form of shooting for sport the principle is the same whether its a tiger or a pheasantwe will widely publicise whats happening in relation to trophy hunting we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and wouldbe mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against iti think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure but it will mobilise public opinion everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a banthe issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade its become an issue in itself but whats really missing from the debate is the consumers choice in that choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools we have seen so many pensions misselling scandals and in the pensions industry theres a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumers terms  that means clear and accessible information to operate that choicefirstly we have our website it features our campaigns and changes every day secondly through our  members who communicate with us thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a preelection conference we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politiciansi think we will be successful its very much the language being used by the main political parties politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issuefuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers we have been hearing about this proposed increase of p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle thats an increase of about â£ if youre running  vehicles its obviously  times thatif fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of businesswe will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press regrettably its one of

2146,brown and blair face new rift claimsfor the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each otherthis time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the governments global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster  an issue many hoped and believed was above such things it dominated the prime ministers monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he told journalists i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers there is a complete unity of purpose and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it  although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the electionso why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr browns longarranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference well not really as it happensand he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declared i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as i read them of course he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two menas far as the timing of the prime ministers press conference is concerned there are two options the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its oncefamed ability to strictly coordinate announcements  through the infamous downing street grid  to avert just such allegationseither way the effect was the same  to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunamihit countries it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the governments response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egyptthen as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott  without mentioning the other all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission  often seen as the prime ministers turf  has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself,0

2149,could rivalry overshadow electiontony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottlealong with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of reelection tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster  a behindclosed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unitymeanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planningbut this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict itfor example the weekends attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their commentsmr blair talked about the new labour manifesto  a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year that claim was repeated in robert pestons book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final actfor his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour reelectedthe trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men one only had to listen to the chancellors friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime ministers apparent attempts to confound mr browns leadership ambitions but it is not just public pronouncements from exaidesthere are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative mannerthen there are the actions of the men themselves gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a mediaonly obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off,0

2153,labour mps fears over squabblingif there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general electionand it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widelyheld view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election as one hugelydisgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised its not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at handas paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respectstephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division we remember the s they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn  who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr browns stead  and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same messagesecondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good  or can even be sustained through the campaign  remains to be seeneven as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime ministers hand for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime ministers timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign mind you we have heard similar pledges before,0

2158,how political squabbles snowballits become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickeringbut this analysis in fact gets it wrong its not just children who fight  adults do too and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree theyd be better off if it ended  but everyone wants to have the last wordeach participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die now this isnt because the participants are stupid  its actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them indeed theres even a piece of economic theory that explains all this nothing as obscure as postneoclassical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted  but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar withits often referred to as the prisoners dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses about a sheriff and two prisoners the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up chargeclearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess  and they are the only one to confess  theyll be let off their crime and he tells them that if they dont confess  and they are the only one not to confess  theyll get life now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess if your partner doesnt confess youll get off completely and if your partner does confess youd better confess to ensure you dont get life the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up dont worry if you dont entirely follow it  you can to look it up on google where there are  entries on itthe prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishlya cold war arms race for example  a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high what economics tells us is that once youre in a prisoners dilemma  unless you are repeating the experience many times over  its hard to escape the perverse logic of it its no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to changein the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomons wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that theyll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly,0
2159,blair looks to election campaigntony blairs big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaignthat poll may still be about  weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto there was a detailed account of the governments past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour  although that may continue to irritate his chancellorthere was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society his was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something  that it is as he said more than an electoral deviceto that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in  and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in  and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters in a key section he declared in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability every family  not just the fortunate few  knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship every adult  including those who missed out at school  able to get the skills then need to advance home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditionsunder what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful postwar chancellor britain has had probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public servicesan unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that  the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word but for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election and for many in westminster mr blairs performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on  may,0

2162,ukips secret weaponby any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else  a winnerthis is the man who some pundits believe was almost singlehandedly responsible for bill clintons sensational  comeback victory but morris is no ideologue he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he is back in london as the uk independence partys notsosecret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped  you guessed it  opposition candidate viktor yushchenko if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoys the game more than the politicsso why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election on this subject morris appears almost evangelicali was on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism a great soundbite but a surprise coming from a new yorker post  september it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who dont believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined thats international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european unionso he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable the tory party is schizophrenic about europe but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they cant possibly renegotiate anything as michael howard is pledged to do its like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain  and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose itso is ukips job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroysilk once notoriously declared no the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to movebut its not just to shift the tories i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blairs decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we are on the subject of mr kilroysilk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk is not a team player  it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some oneso what is the big plan for the general election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said neither does ukip have to fight every seat as with the  us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats  just as he believes it will in britain so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll the internet was a decisive factor in the  presidential election  through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries people just did it anything can happen in the next general election there is an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voicethat might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power it is a huge task surely but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises  even while most still believe it is labours for the taking ukips performance in last years european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus and after all he has a reputation to sustain,0

2165,defection timed to hit tax pledgewith impeccable and preciselycalculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howards latest announcement on taxation and spendingwith just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories resolutely depressing poll showings the big idea is his â£bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc ones breakfast with frost programme he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges but mr howard announced that of the â£bn he has earmarked from savings â£bn will be used to plug labours claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwins first budget he would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax but he did for the first time say there would be such tax cutsat this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less it is the tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact mr howard however was dismissive these things happen from time to time there are disagreements between robert jackson and methe election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did he added and that is certainly true the election will be decided on the economy stupid other issues like the iraq war and the trust thing will also play a major part but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda mr howard knows that risks accusations that as a result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen,0

2179,kennedys cautious optimismcharles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general electionin his  years in the commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the uks political and electoral system but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time look i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the real oppositionbut doesnt that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced but havent we been here before with suggestions in the s that labour was finished wont voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that geographically the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britainmr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour votershe insists his three headline commitments to be financed from a  tax increase on those earning over â£ a year will appeal right across the political spectrum they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claimswe are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policiesthat is a clear cut choice for people one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others as to his own future he is clear if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side,0

2185,terror powers expose tyrannythe lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest where there isnt enough evidence to put them on triallord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the movethere is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain or so says home secretary charles clarke my reaction so what it is not that i am cynical or just do not care i care about this country very muchbut in the  years that i have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at us my point is the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat but that is what the blair government now seeks to do  create a tyranny to defend us from the alqaeda tyrannyi was born on  august  the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler a week after my first birthday the threat had become reality we were at war my father wore a uniform for five years after  we yearned for peace at last but in  winston churchill told us  from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe behind the iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat josef stalin triggered the cold war with the berlin blockade in  my whole generation was blighted by itwe were threatened by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals we took silly precautions some fought it some marched futilely against it some pretended it was not there the cold war lasted  years but we remained a parliamentary democracy by the early seventies it was terrorism as well al fatah black september red brigades but most of all for us the ira and the inla thirty more years  policemen and women over  soldiers more than  civilians dead but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny that was why the tyrants lost civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources yes  and one judge nojury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle but habeas corpus did not die right of appeal was not abolished now the threat is islamic fundamentalism its leaders want to destroy our society so did the irait is based and funded abroad so was the ira it has sleeper fanatics inside our society so did the ira it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents so was the ira the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial neither were the ira but we did and without becoming a tyranny now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government minister to be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny but a tyranny is based on the citizens terror this is not victory this is defeat before a shot is firedan interesting article  its good to see widening participation in the debate  but i suggest we move one step further our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the shadows cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedomi agree with frederick forsyth we really cant deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isnt any our security services behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away remember there were no wmd in iraq just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terroristin this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without chargetrial etc apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for examplethis country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whom when id cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id is being checkedthe threat now is new you cannot compare the threats of past years with now forsyth says  died over  years or terrorism  people died in one morning in ny on september th  the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology a kilo of semtex will flatten a building a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible i agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of masshysteria and talking up the threat but talkingdown the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable toothe problem with this issue is not that it isnt important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no however as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too faras somebody of chinese origin i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life whilst life wasnt perfect we could make better for ourselves now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do we have to be politicallycorrect and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions lets hope the bbc doesnt get gagged for letting people express their views the people have the right to know and the bbcs role is to inform educate and entertaini agree terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties in the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy the terrorists have already woni absolutely agree with frederick forsyth yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate the idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant ricin for example is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fearif the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to othersi agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries  the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court that goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew bestwhen you look at todays britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing the datefrederick forsyth puts it beautifully the government is seeking to introduce a police state the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the unbritish idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of  years we are sleepwalking into this wake upan interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat  if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence  the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it because these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked we wont have much of a society left to debate hes correct in most of what he says mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect nowsurely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how longthey were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attacki dont usually have much time for mr forsyths largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the uk but it is very doubtful whether alqaeda is a global organisation coordinating this the rise of surveillance cameras id cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit where will this end as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the uk its government will soon have its people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombsmr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise thank youmr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times for very little return and maximum alienation these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the sameforsyth is wrong the nature of the current threat is new it is no longer to our armed forces as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was it is to you and i the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately the best comparison is therefore the blitz  at this time let us not forget suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public we must not forget we are at warid say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a when not an if probability ill bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didnt do enough to protect the uk people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blairi agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government i believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing it should be of great concern to everyonei am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorismhow true there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the s i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from withinmr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failed as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of todays terrorists we may need to do things a little differently let us hope notfrederic forsythes comments seem to me to be a wellthoughtout analysis of why we human society as a whole and britain in particular should resist the temptation to overprotect through fear it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr forsythes opening comments suggesti am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neitherthe government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made a policy to deal with it its all very well criticising that policy but if mr forsythe cant draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative i say so what to his opinionsfrederick forsyths rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balancei rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth but in this instance i think he is correct the rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending if the government can hold suspects without charge or trial whats nexti agree absolutely by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror our democratic system is not perfect but as churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedomi do not usually agree with mr forsyth but he is spot on here the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisationalthough in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point alqaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of people the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movementyes i agree with mr forsyths views i do not believe the governments plans are justified there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us presidents interpretation of democracy and freedom he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii the wars to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generationsmr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little austrianthomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labours propositions like new labour he called himself a libertarian like new labour he believed he was promoting the peoples best interests but as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty  the liberty to live  man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so i hope new labour suffers the same treatmenti agree with mr forsyths views the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy they must not be allowed to get away with itof course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and hes wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etcmy background is somewhat similar to freddies so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedomswhilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism who is to decide whom is a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years what is to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers who will support their families will their children still go to school it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany stalins russia ceausescus romania  the list goes on it looks as if a new dark age is comingi see that opinion on mr forsyths remarks are divided the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they dont like or are scared of but history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power after all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you and that day youll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fightingi never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth but im in wholehearted agreement with him on this one we as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda which of course also means well inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well tried  tested back door methods i grieve for the future of my children its no wonder theyre adamant they dont ever want any of their ownthis government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this puts it on a par with the government of burmalike many of your respondents i wouldnt usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clarks proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsythi agree with mr forsyth just look at the facts  our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed its case based on fear the facts turned out to be very different if individuals are treated in the same distorted way then weve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs we become animals tooi agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said  if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk  how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat however it appears that he has misunderstood the term islamic fundamentalism it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the quraan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does shehe kill innocent women men and children this person is selfreflective and constantly tries to better herhis actions by being good to others the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions on top of that they claim to be following islam in its true formi accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference  in northern ireland internment certainly didnt achieve anything  the bombings didnt stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the britishbeing eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where i write this and also to the left in the city of london notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of  downing street there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq even when england was in true peril in  apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards which winston churchill decided had to go since he said the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities incidentally i can still remember my old id card number hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neuteredwhat can i add to mr forsyths eloquently put arguments except applause well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny,0

2188,kilroy launches veritas partyexbbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroysilk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroysilk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas  latin for truth  would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilkmr kilroysilk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics on thursday mr kilroysilk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election  that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have leftmr kilroysilk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straightmr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroysilk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroysilk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroysilk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroysilk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to leadveritas its the bnp in an expensive suitits all well and good robert kilroysilk claiming that veritas is a party that doesnt believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the twohorse race trend in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smokescreen for his antiislamism slurs which got him sacked from the televisioni think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoongood to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done lets hope kilroysilk ukip and the eurosceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from itall mouth and trousers a clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third termwhatever kilroysilk and ukip do none of their antieuropean policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from rightwing england but will have little impact in wales or scotlandhopefully this all this fighting within eurosceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we cant rely on the usa foreverat last an impetus for increasing the likely  turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda  the uk  and ill be voting for himboth ukip and rks are representatives of smallmindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these peoples bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiffmany people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibilitythe very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the pollsive always thought that kilroysilk was a selfpublicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinionbrilliant about time this country had a plausible partyhaving seen the recent bbc  documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroysilk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his actionfantastic news proeuropeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mids and the extreme antieuropeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroysilks ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemyas a euroenthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroysilks behaviour he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coupdetat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straightdownthemiddle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each otherif every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose wed have ballot papers a mile long youve got to hand it to kilroysilk for his sheer arrogance and supreme selfbeliefwhilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eus comments last week about michael howards plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states the sooner we leave this corrupt superstate the betterdoes anyone else think that it is ironic that eurosceptic kilroysilk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man  contradictory vain and pompousi think mr kilroysilk has got a very good point british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped if mr kilroysilk lives up to half his promises he will get my votehonestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no ideaas one of kilroysilks east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliamentukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukips democratic naturekilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they didnt seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i sayoh please this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousnessthe refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like i shall be voting for himthe electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroysilk but for the ukip kilroysilk was made an mep because of his position on the ukips party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliamenti wouldnt write off kilroysilk while hes a clown and a one man band at the moment hes a populist and thats always dangerousthe man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in successgood luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battlethe man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my countrys knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today  but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me whats more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as evergreat stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only englishspeaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hardworking immigrants  our economy needs themthis is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote furtherthank goodness that kilroysilk has gone  now ukip at least has a chance in the electionit is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroysilk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroysilk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in infightingukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroysilk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroysilkif he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a byelections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to anotherso ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to followinteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin nameevery opinion poll points to an overwhelming antieurope feeling in this country kilroysilk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroysilk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have comewell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy herelets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroysilk slipping into obscurityveritas the

2239,will tory tax cuts lift spiritsmichael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cutsshould he win the next general election he has earmarked â£ billion that will be used to reduce taxes  although he still will not say which or how this was the preelection message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income taxall the money would come from its â£ billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that â£ billion would go on spending plans with â£ billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cutsneither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eyecatching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he saidit is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cutsthe extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard  can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned â£bn efficiency savings simply dont add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasyone of new labours greatest successes before the historic  election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely  and the prime minister probably hopes  that the economy will be the deciding factor,0

2275,minimum wage increased to â£the minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than m people the government has announcedadults must be paid at least â£ an hour up from â£ while  to  year olds will be paid â£ the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in  businesses wanted it frozen warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a â£ ratea further increase in the adult rate to â£ an hour is provisionally scheduled for october  according to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact said chairman adair turner the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women  with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressingunveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness for too long poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hardworking families he said too often people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast the government has not accepted the commissions recommendation that yearolds should be paid at the adult rate but says it will look again at the rate later on mr brown said we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wagethe national minimum wage is currently set at â£ per hour for those aged  and above and at â£ for those aged  to  a â£ per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for  to yearolds but apprentices are exempt the trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for a â£ minimum wage by next year but the confederation of british industry cbi called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october and david frost director of the british chambers of commerce said the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation what employers are saying to us now is that its at a level where its starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the countrythe liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage its not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too he said conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase speaking on bbc radio s womans hour mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowestpaid workers there are people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really shouldnt be paying income tax he saidit would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below â£ a year with say no tax on below â£ the losses in tax can be recouped by having a pc tax band for people making over â£ our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only rds of the us perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost  more here than they do in the us this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the lowpaid people do make go much furtherits still not good enough i got a part time job at  when i was doing my alevels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni this was only  years ago and i was getting paid â£ an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe its about time    year olds got a fair wagewe must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all togetherany increase is certainly welcome news however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than â£ an hour thought not  so then dont expect others to eitheri cant believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you its about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldnt go a miss either br gtthis is good news the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a workers relationship with their employer wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employees efforts for too long wages were a point of exploitation  what could an employer get away with in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep lowpaid wages low with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removedit is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fatcat salaries bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purri feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people cant afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand outhere come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses we all remember michael howards protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced  funny how hes gone quiet on that one jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in i think if any job is worth doing then its worth being paid a fair wage for and â£ is hardly a fortune if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe its not being run properly and if it folds a betterrun company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business ownersgreat keep at it tony i remember the despair of the s and the low wages employers got away with at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working we cant afford not to pay a decent wage its not a jobs at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decencythe increase in minimum wage is a good thing living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely like the rest of the country over the past  years has made living for you average  years old very difficult in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by p an hour hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a  figure salary the chance to branch out on our owni work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services  domestic catering  portering etc  pay the minimum wage of â£ as the basic rate someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allowthis is definitely the right step in the right direction it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well this is a million votes more good strategy isnt italthough i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinks i am quite prepared for a raft of bribes to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards they are playing us for the fools they think we arethis is extremely bad news for any business  whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage companies from settingup business in the uk or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere the jubilation felt by lowpaid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobsthis will only lead to a reduction in jobs why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india blair says the economy is strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the countrys debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforcethe timing cannot be coincidental this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as suchandrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneering i dont mind if it is in our degraded democracy elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed if my maths is right a  hour week at â£ gives you an annual income just over â£ and raising it to â£ leaves it under â£ the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firmi am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as sweat shop but now we are told it is global competition with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing the whole picture needs to be looked atthis is great news but that might be because i work for minimum wage seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job when you can earn more from claiming than you can from work there is no incentive perhaps a step in the right directionif the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close  this will put more people out of work how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close uswhile im delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses as an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last octobers increase for the lower paid employees  who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum this latest increase of p an hour will cause even more financial hardship if the rate rises to â£ then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employeesthe increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff overtime being the first to goi currently employ  staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery  of my costs are labour the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businessesit is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage  this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobsi know about this great idea  dont bother getting qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parents dont get fined because remember when you do eventually start working doesnt matter how lazy you are youll be guaranteed a decent wage the ones who suffer are the employersi hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury wont take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back doori dont believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them now before everyone thinks that i am some richkid i can assure you i am not i came from a very much working class background and started work  years ago on a youth opportunity program earning â£ per week i worked hard went to college part time got my alevels and degree  bettered myself i now earn a  figure salary i did that through hard work and getting off my backside a minimum wage just makes people complacentto ashley of swindon when you earned â£ per week it was worth something these days that â£ would need to be near to â£ to have the equivalent buying power i might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done  years ago at equivalent wages in my day type arguments are a view that belong in the your day   years agoas a graduate working for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can get i disagree with ashley swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay i have my gcses alevels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that cant afford the wages i should be getting i should be on at least x what im getting but they cant afford it we all work hard but the money is just not there but on the plus side i love my job and wouldnt change it just to get more payas an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional â£ per year these next rises will cost me more i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers so no one really wins in the endin answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end on the contrary mr blair wins  he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the â£ mark there will be  more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt  namely mine think of us employers as well mr blair we are not all big corporations earning millionsall workers should be entitled to a fair days pay for a fair days work how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirementit is good news for many asians living in uk students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country i thank mr blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage,0

2301,profile gordon brownthe ultimate prize of  downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a recordbreaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern timeshe reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and  days between  and  how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors  or politicians  before himgordon brown was born in glasgow on  february  the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at  he was canvassing for labour and by his s he was a leading political activist in scotland he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour partyhis first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in  was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in  he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal townsentering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smiths leadership in  after the death of leader john smith in  he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islingtonthe other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blairs supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns  and even a television film  have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in  mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the  election campaign he is said to have worked an average of  hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morningthis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr browns former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of exking michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politicsif that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in  changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in  their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary  days after being born seven weeks prematurely a year later in october  the couple had a son  john  an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human sidethe ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brownblair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to questiona truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the preelection campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown  using the budget as a springboard  is to revitalise labours campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown  including mr milburn  but none can command
